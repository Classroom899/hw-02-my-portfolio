Responsive Portfolio: 
hw-02-my-portfolio

This portfolio is the first portfolio I have ever created. Portfolio website has a responsive design with mobile accessibility.

Bootstrap CSS Framework was used to create this responsive portfolio. Included is a home section, about, contact, and portfolio section that has placeholder images with more work to come. 

Carousel Bootstrap ability is used, grids, and a logo. 

Please ask for any questions.
